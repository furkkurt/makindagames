            Greetings traveler! Welcome to the official homepage of makinDAGames! It's a one-man-army, founded by one of the pioneer game developers of our century; Ahmet Furkan Kurt. Let's get to know this great man a little better!

          <p class="pt-8 text-xl bold">
            Born on a cold winter's evening on 02/12/2002 at the exquisite weight of 4 kilograms. When they asked toddler Furkan what he wanted to be when he was grown up, he always answered "Robotic Engineer" which means he almost made up his mind on his career path straight from the moment he could talk.<br><br>After 3 years in kindergarten from ages 3 to 6, where he was taught about the great Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's Ideals, he went on a wild 8-year ride in the Selami Ali Grade-school, that became Selami Ali Mid-School just the year Furkan started mid-school. There he started making his business network.<br><br>Towards the end of mid-school, he was enthusiastic about game development, and he was already making text-based games using batch scripting.

          <p class="pt-8 text-xl bold">
            Followed his path to wisdom at Halide Edip Adƒ±var Anatolian High School in the heart of Istanbul. This great sanctuary of education opened up many tech-related courses the most important ones being "Robotic Coding" and "Web Development" where Furkan learned how to use Arduino, HTML, CSS, and PHP, later on went on to learn JS to start his career as a Front-End web developer. And that's also the time he bid farewell to Windows, switched to Linux, and started reading about the "Free Software Movement".<br><br>Towards the end of high school, he discovered the Phaser framework and Apache Cordova and started developing Mobile Games. His first mobile game was "A Mile" which to be honest did not use the Phaser Framework, just plain JS. ported for Android using Cordova. It's a text-based RPG game with an open-world setting like the ones he used to do with bash scripting years ago.

          <p class="pt-8 text-xl bold">
            After getting into Firat University which is known for it's success in informatics related programs, he kept on working on front end web and mobile game development jobs. And it's the goal to get all the mobile games ported to be played on web, on this site. Work in progress boys!<br><br>He also studied one year in Spain so he is very international. Who knows more, the one who travels much or the one who reads much? Well no worries cause Furkan is on both tables. Check his goodreads profile on the contacts page!

            You may think wow this guy should be on gring 24/7 but you would be WRONG! Furkan has many hobies such as capoeria, calisthenics, banjo playing, pen spinning and songwriting! Which will be presented here in blog page probably.
